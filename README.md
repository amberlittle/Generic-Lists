# Generic-Lists
This is a Java project using genetic lists

I recently worked on a project in my software design class, where I had to implement my own versions 
of the stack and queue data structures that can be used similarly to ArrayList<> which was used for 
generic data types. I implemented the java interface iterator to use this.
